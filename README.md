# cardProject
Hey People! Shalini this side..
This card project consists of three visually appealing and responsive cards designed using HTML and CSS.
Each card represents different content and styling. T
he first card focuses on front-end skills, showcasing an image, a title, and a description. 
The second card is an order summary with an image, text, pricing details, and buttons for further actions. 
The third card offers insights for business growth, displaying text, statistics, and a background image. 
The project demonstrates the use of flexbox, positioning, gradients, borders, and box shadows to create engaging card layouts.
